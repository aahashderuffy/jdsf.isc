   If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer network, 
   you have to make sure that it provides a way for users to get its source. 
   For example, if your program is a web application, its interface could display 
   a "Source" link that leads users to an archive of the code. There are many ways 
   you could offer source, and different solutions will be better for different programs; 
   see section 13 of the GNU Affero General Public License for the specific requirements.
